Peppermint Mocha Recipe

Ingredients Needed:
Milk: I use whole milk, but feel free to use whatever milk you have in your fridge Non-dairy milk works great too!
Sugar: for a little bit of sweetness!
Cocoa Powder: use unsweetened powder to give your mocha its chocolate flavor.
Coffee: brewed espresso or strong coffee both work great.
Peppermint Flavor: to add peppermint flavor you can use: 1) mint extract, 2) half of a peppermint candy cane, or 3) peppermint syrup.
Vanilla Extract: provides a touch of extra sweetness and adds some flavor depth.
Toppings: we’re topping our Peppermint Mocha off with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.
