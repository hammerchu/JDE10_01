A classic! Here's a simple and delicious chicken curry recipe that serves 4-6 people:

**Ingredients:**

* 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 2 medium onions, diced
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 medium ginger, grated
* 1 tablespoon curry powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for some heat)
* 1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes
* 1 cup chicken broth
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* Fresh cilantro, for garnish
* Cooking oil or ghee, for frying

**Instructions:**

1. **Heat oil in a pan**: Heat 2 tablespoons of oil or ghee in a large pan over medium heat.
2. **Sauté onions**: Add the diced onions and sauté until they're translucent and lightly browned (about 5 minutes).
3. **Add garlic and ginger**: Add the minced garlic and grated ginger. Sauté for another minute, until fragrant.
4. **Add chicken**: Add the chicken pieces and cook until they're browned on all sides and cooked through (about 5-7 minutes). Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.
5. **Add spices**: Add the curry powder, cumin, turmeric, and cayenne pepper (if using). Sauté for 1 minute, until the spices are fragrant.
6. **Add tomatoes and broth**: Add the diced tomatoes and chicken broth. Stir well to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer.
7. **Return chicken to the pan**: Add the cooked chicken back to the pan and stir to coat with the curry sauce.
8. **Simmer and season**: Simmer the curry for 10-15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is fully coated. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
9. **Garnish and serve**: Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve over rice, with naan or roti, or with some crusty bread.

**Variations and tips:**

* Use coconut milk instead of chicken broth for a creamier curry.
* Add potatoes, carrots, or bell peppers to make a hearty and flavorful curry.
* Use different types of peppers, such as jalapeño or serrano, for varying levels of heat.
* Experiment with different spice blends, such as garam masala or Madras curry powder, for unique flavor profiles.
* Make it a one-pot meal by cooking the rice and chicken together in the same pan.
